# reddsource

An openSource reddit client

## Why?

There are many Reddit apps already out there. But none of these apps satisfied
all of my needs or was open source so I could add my own features. Due to this I started 
developing this app.

## I have a problem

Just create a Github issue describing the problem. If you are a developer, if
possible attach a stack trace or/and error message. An example project or file
is always nice to have to fix your problem as fast as possible.

## How to contribute

You fixed an bug? Or just added an feature? Just create a PR with a description
about what you added/changed. Make sure, that the design fits the rest of the
app and have fun :) Tests will be implemented later.

## Special thanks
